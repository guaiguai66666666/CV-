1. **Installation of Necessary Packages**：
   - Keywords: OpenCV, Tesseract, Python
   - Installation of essential packages: OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract for OCR (Optical Character Recognition). It imports these libraries using Python.

2. **Reading Images**：
   - Keywords: cv2.imread, Image Paths
   - It explains how to read images using OpenCV's `cv2.imread` function, specifying the image path.

3. **OCR with Tesseract**：
   - Keywords: pytesseract.image_to_string, Custom Configurations
   - The text is extracted from images using Tesseract's `image_to_string` function. Custom configurations, such as `--oem 3 --psm 6`, are added to optimize OCR performance.

4. **Image Preprocessing Techniques**：
   - Keywords: Median Blur, Thresholding, Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Canny Edge Detection
   - Various preprocessing techniques are discussed, including median blur for noise removal, thresholding for binarization, dilation and erosion for image enhancement, opening for foreground extraction, and Canny edge detection for identifying edges.

5. **Skew Correction**：
   - Keywords: cv2.minAreaRect, Image Rotation
   - The document mentions skew correction, which involves identifying the angle of rotation and correcting it using `cv2.warpAffine`.

6. **Template Matching**：
   - Keywords: cv2.matchTemplate, Template Images
   - Template matching is briefly touched upon, using `cv2.matchTemplate` to find instances of a template image within a larger image.

7. **Drawing Boxes Around Text**：
   - Keywords: pytesseract.image_to_boxes, Bounding Boxes
   - It describes how to use `pytesseract.image_to_boxes` to get the bounding boxes of text blocks and draw them on the image.

8. **Recognizing Text with Confidence Scores**：
   - Keywords: Text Confidence, Bounding Boxes
   - It shows how to recognize text blocks with a confidence score higher than 60 and draw bounding boxes around them.

9. **Custom Detection for Numbers Only**：
   - Keywords: Custom Configurations, Digit Recognition
   - The document outlines how to use custom configurations to recognize only numbers from an image.

10. **Processing Multiple Pages and Writing Results to a File**：
    - Keywords: Loop for Pages, Preprocessing, Text Writing
    - It mentions defining a function `read_text_from_image` to preprocess images, perform OCR, and write the results to a file. This function is then used in a loop to process multiple pages.
